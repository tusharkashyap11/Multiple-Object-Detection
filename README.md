# Multiple Object Detection

This project demonstrates the usage of a pre-trained model in TensorFlow.js for performing multiple (overlapping) object detection in images. It utilizes the COCO-SSD model to recognize objects and their positions with high accuracy.

**Note: The npm files included in this project are not necessary for the code to work currently. They are intended for the future migration of this project to MediaPipe.**

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Multiple-Object-Detection
```
3. Open the project in a web browser:
   - You can use a local development server such as Live Server or serve the files using Python's built-in HTTP server. For example, using Python 3:

python3 -m http.server

4. Access the application:
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate port number if using a different local server).
